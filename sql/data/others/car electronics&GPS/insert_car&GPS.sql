				'Fitness Band That Moves at the Pace of Your Life
•Learns your activity level and assigns a personalized daily goal
•Displays steps, calories, distance; monitors sleep
•Pairs with heart rate monitor¹ for fitness activities
•1+ year battery life; water-resistant²
•Save, plan and share progress at Garmin Connect™

You already know the active steps you take now can improve your overall wellness today, tomorrow and well into your future. And while it seems simple to get out of that chair more often and move, making it stick is another matter. That’s where vívofit can turn good intentions into lifelong habits. It’s the only fitness band that greets you with a personalized daily goal, tracks your progress and reminds you when it’s time to move.

Personalized Daily Goals
 
vívofit learns your current activity level, then assigns an attainable daily goal. As you meet your milestones, vívofit will adjust your goal for the next day, gradually nudging you toward a healthier lifestyle. At Garmin Connect™, our free online fitness community, you can earn virtual badges and view your progress.

Tells Time and "Time to Move"

Research shows prolonged periods of inactivity such as sitting at a desk decreases your body’s production of fat-burning enzymes. You can reverse that effect by taking frequent, short walk breaks throughout your day. And while you might lose track of time and forget to move, vívofit knows. A red move bar appears on the display after 1 hour of inactivity and builds when you’ve been sitting too long. Just walk for a couple of minutes to reset the move bar.

Keep Moving

When you’re ready to take the next steps toward better health, vívofit has additional features to keep you motivated. Use a heart rate monitor¹ with vívofit to record your heart rate and zone data and get more accurate calorie burn information for any fitness activity, such as a run or a cardio class at the gym. At Garmin Connect, you can join online challenges with other vívofit users or start your own competition with friends to compete for virtual badges and bragging rights.

Always On

vívofit follows your progress 24/7, and it can stay on for more than a year without a battery change. Set the sleep mode when you go to bed and vívofit will monitor your rest. At Garmin Connect, you can see your total sleep hours as well as periods of movement and restful sleep. The vívofit band is water-resistant², so you can shower or get caught in the rain, worry-free.

Get Connected

With the touch of one button, you can wirelessly sync vívofit with Garmin Connect to see a complete picture of your progress, join online challenges and earn virtual badges for extra motivation. You can access our free online community from your computer or on your compatible mobile device³ with the Garmin Connect™ Mobile app.

A New Adventure

Mapping Performance

This handheld GPS is armed with a sunlight-readable, 2.2-inch color display and a worldwide basemap with shaded relief, making it easier than ever to know where you are and where you are headed next.

With internal memory and a microSD card slot, the eTrex 20 ready for a wide array of detailed maps. Add TOPO U.S. 24K maps to hit the trail, BlueChart g2 preloaded cards for a day on the water, or City Navigator maps for turn-by-turn routing on roads.

Rock Solid GPS

With its high-sensitivity, WAAS-enabled GPS receiver, eTrex 20 will locate your position quickly and precisely, maintaining its GPS location even in heavy cover and deep canyons.


With added HotFix and GLONASS support, you can count on faster positioning and a more reliable signal--whether you are in deep woods or just near tall buildings and trees, you can count on eTrex 20 to help you find your way when you need it the most.

Rugged and Ready

The eTrex 20 is a breeze to operate, indoors and out, with five buttons on either side within easy reach. With its bright orange case and included lanyard, it is tough to lose. Plus, since the eTrex 20 is waterproof to IPX7 standards, it can take an accidental splash or dunk in the water and still continue to perform.

Find It and Go

With eTrex 20, your adventure will last, with over 20 hours of battery life on two AA batteries (rechargeable NiMH or Lithium batteries work great). As a handheld, it is plenty portable, weighing in at just 5 ounces with batteries. It is also compatible with a variety of spine mounting accesories, for use in cycling or other activities.

Paperless Geocaching

eTrex 20 also supports geocaching, a high-tech version of hide-and-seek where you explore the outdoors in search of hidden "treasure" and adventure. Geocaching is a real-world, outdoor treasure hunting game using GPS-enabled devices. Participants (members) navigate to a specific set of GPS coordinates and then attempt to find the geocache (container) hidden at that location. The eTrex 20 is the perfect way to get started.
